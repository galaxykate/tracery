# Tracery for Ruby

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tracery.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tracery)

## Basic usage

Please refer to the [Tracery readme](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) for information about how to build grammars.

Using the ruby port is very similar to the Javascript version. First, install the tracery gem: `gem install tracery`.

```ruby
require 'tracery'
require 'mods-eng-basic'
include Tracery
grammar = createGrammar({"origin" => "foo"});
grammar.addModifiers(Modifiers.baseEngModifiers);
puts grammar.flatten("#origin#")
```

## Known issues

* Currently does not support rulesets with conditionals, distributions, or ranked fallbacks
* No current plan to support visualizations
* Not yet compatible with `:symbolic` hash inputs

## TODO

* Create new modifiers based on Rails inflection library
